NIT Conclave is the gathering of the intellectual cream of the nation for the sessions of
unparalleled brain-storming and exchange of ideas. It proposes great prospects of discussion on
Technology, Training &amp; Placements and Entrepreneurship. NIT Conclave is a common platform
for fruitful interaction amongst the NITs - to come together and deliberate on issues pertaining
to progress and development of the nation as a whole. Instead of being confined to theorize
on a designated problem, delegates shall strive to address existing real issues that are
hindering the nation's progress. It is a matter of immense pride for us to host the Sixth Season of the conclave at NIT Rourkela. We shall put all the required efforts to maintain the legacy our counterparts have created.

The Proposed theme of NIT Conclave ’16 is “India and Scientific research”. It is an attempt to discuss on and improve <br />
the research scenario in the country particularity within the NIT’s.<br/><br/> 

India is in the process of rapidly expanding and reforming research in higher technical institutions and <br />
other research institutions. It is a true fact that technical and research institutions of national importance <br />
and lagging far behind in terms of research output. The number of research documents produced by our country<br /> 
are less as compared to the 8 biggest nations. A proper research environment is required in these technical<br /> 
institutions to establish itself as a center of excellence. Apart from the main theme focusing on scientific <br />
research, other domains of discussing would be “entrepreneurship and start-up ecosystem” as well as <br />
“Alumni Relations development”. With these in mind, it is proposed to organise the 3 day long NIT Conclave to <br />
bring together some of the best young minds in order to address the challenge and how to go about it.

            <div id="panel3" class="panel">
NIT Conclave is conducted annually with a vision to equip enthusiasts from these institutions of national importance with necessary skills &amp; knowledge and to provide them with a favourable environment to pitch their ideas so that they could serve the country in a better way. We aim to build a stronger inter NIT network so that we could implement each other&#39;s ideas and establish uniformity in quality in our institutions. We, through our efforts wish to improve the quality of education so as to produce superior quality of Technocrats, thereby strengthening the Brand. Issues pertaining to NITs as a whole will be discussed with the views of identifying the obstacles
that are acting as a hindrance to our growth as a brand. Notable personalities including policy
and decision makers will be enlightening us on the vital aspects of innovation as well as
overcoming hindrance on the road to success.

<div id="first-section"><a class="holder" id="box1"><span style="color:#000000;">Regional Engineering Colleges, abbreviated as RECs were established with an aim to promote multicultural diversity. Since their inception in the 1960&#39;s these institutions have been producing some of the finest technocrats and have created a remarkable alumni base. Owing to their enormous potential and to quench the country&#39;s demand for proficient technocrats, the Govt of India decided to take the reigns of these institutions in their own hands. They were Nationalised to be known as National Institutes of Technology or NITs in the year 2002. NITs were later declared Institutions of National Importance by the Govt of India in the year 2007.<br />
NIT conclave aims to bridge the gap between various NITs across the country and is a significant step towards building a strong inter NIT network. Delegations comprising of five student representatives each meet to discuss on ways of implementing new ideas so as to improve the quality of education in their institutions. The two day event also observes guest lectures from some of the most prominent personalities of the country! The conclave is aimed at betterment of these young Institutions of National importance so as to strengthen the Brand NIT. It is a matter of immense pride for us to host the Fifth Season of the conclave at NIT Jalandhar. We shall put all the required efforts to maintain the legacy our counterparts have created </span></a></div>

<div id="second-section"><a class="holder" id="box1"><span style="color:#000000;">The theme for current edition of NIT Conclave is &quot;INNOVATION, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND STARTUP ECOSYSTEM&quot;, an attempt to encourage the innovative ideas to bloom and thrive. Through the concept of startup ecosystem, students would be able to find the right ground to sow their ideas and the right kind of support to help them germinate. Its these ideas, these bulletproof, non particulate waves that later convert to one&#39;s intellectual property or a venture as huge as Facebook. Hence, a need to protect these ideas, through proper care and careful handling, becomes indispensable. The chief objective of the conference is to provide the aspiring entrepreneurs with a promoting platform to give them a head start. The correct patronage can help produce challenging future industrialists. A strong industrial base shall further facilitate the growth of the Indian economy. Brilliant minds put together can create wonders. This year NIT Conclave is all about creating a simultaneous development model for potential entrepreneurs. So, look forward to exhaustive discussions and seminars on innovation and the concept of startup ecosystem and opportunity to present your innovation which might even be realized by the venture capitalists. </span></a></div>
